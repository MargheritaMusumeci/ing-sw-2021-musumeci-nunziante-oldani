# every line that starts with # will be ignored by the class that reads this file
# In this file i've put the list of requirements for every card in this order
#
# Cards are dived by level
# Then by color
# Then are listed in crescent order based on life points
#
# Colour order: green, blu, yellow, purple
# A line that starts with n will identify a new card, the next line will describe the level, then the colour, then the cost,
# then the requirement as an array of number, then the production and in the end the life points
# order of array: rock, shield, coins, servants, faith
